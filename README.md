# Zillow-Regression-Project

## Project description with goals
### Description
* We want to be able to predict the property tax assessed values ('taxvaluedollarcnt') of Single Family Properties that had a transaction during 2017

### GoalsÂ¶
* Construct an ML Regression model that predicts propery tax assessed values ('taxvaluedollarcnt') of Single Family Properties using attributes of the properties.

* Find the key drivers of property value for single family properties.
* Deliver a report that the data science team can read through and replicate, understand what steps were taken, why and what the outcome was.
* Make recommendations on what works or doesn't work in predicting these homes' values.

## Initial hypotheses and/or questions you have of the data, ideas
There should be some combination of features that can be used to build a predictive model for property values
* 1. Do any of 
* 2. Do 
* 3. Do 
* 4. Do

** Project Plan 
*** Acquire data from Codeup DB Server
*** Prepare data
    **** Create Engineered columns from existing data
        ***** contract_types
        ***** customer_churn
        ***** customer_contracts
        ***** customer_details
        ***** customer_payments
        ***** customers
        ***** customer_signups
        ***** customer_subscriptions
        ***** internet_service_types
        ***** payment_types
*** Explore data in search of drivers of churn
    **** Answer the folowwing initial questions
        ***** 1. Do any of the demographic features provide relevant preditive value for churn?
        ***** 2. Do catagorical customer account features provide relevant predictive value for churn?
        ***** 3. Do numerical customer account features provide relevant predictive value for churn?
        ***** 4. Do any of the service features provide relevant predictive value for churn? 
*** Develop a model to predict if a customer will churn
*** Draw conclusions

##Steps to Reproduce
* 1.Clone this repo.
* 2.Acquire the data from Codeup DB Server
* 3.Put the data in the file containing the cloned repo.
* 4.Run notebook.

## Takeaways and Conclusions
* Of the features examined these provided statiscally relevant predictive value for predicting customer churn
** Account features
*** tenure
*** monthly_charges
** Demographic features
*** partner_Yes
*** dependents_Yes
** Other features
*** tech_support_Yes
*** internet_service_type_fiber_optic
*** payment_type_electronic_check
*Three major drivers
** Customers with Fiber Optic Internet Service churn faster than others
** Customers without Tech support turn at a higher rate than those with it
** Legacy customers are less likly to churn than newer customers

# Recomendations
* Implement the model provided and work with the marketing to form retention programs to reduce the churn rate for the company.
* These programs can be offered to seperate test markets derived from this model and later be evaluated to determine which retention program works best
* Investigate reason for fiber optic customers without tech support churning faster than others
